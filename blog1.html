    </header>
    
    <p class="blog-para">For better or worse, the COVID 19 pandemic gave us a lot of free time and a lot of free courses, seriously a lot. There's no doubt this time could be used productively to work on ourselves, grow as humans and develop new skills or sometimes just connect with our friends and family.
    Time is a blessing and should be utilised properly. I'm not saying you should become a machine and constantly work on something all the time, it's always a good idea to take a break - to sit back and relax. But I'm here to warn you, to not waste your time, as I did.</p>
    
    <br>

    <h2 class="blog-heading">THE ILLUSION OF SUCCESS</h2>
    <p class="blog-para">The abundance of free online courses and the amount of free time in our hands is a deadly combination. Of course, this sounds great, you can learn a lot, develop new skills and put them into action for the better. Right? No.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p class="blog-para">First of all, most "free courses" are free for a reason. They are almost always base level. You cannot learn something to its core from an online course. Sure, it's a good head start. If you develop a further interest you can master the skill through some paid coaching or a high-skill course.
    The thing is most p class="blog-para"eople don't transcend to the later part. Why would they? There are so many "free courses" available. This leads them into a rabbit hole of finishing endless courses.</p>

    <br>
    
    <p class="blog-para">Completing one course after another gives a sense of accomplishment, add that with the certificates provided. This makes the student feel accomplished and on the right path.
    Okay, so you're still not sure why this is bad? Collecting a bunch of certificates and gaining base knowledge about different skills will make you <strong><i>Jack of all trades, master of none.</i></strong> </p>

    <br>

    <h2 class="blog-heading">PERSONAL REGRETS</h2>
    <p class="blog-para">I've spent the better half of my pandemic completing a bunch of free online courses and collecting random certificates. As a result, I now have sub-par knowledge about half a dozen skills but no real mastery in any of them. I can't use this half-knowledge to create any meaningful projects or apply for a job. For the most part, this could help me get an internship.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p class="blog-para">If I had found a well-structured roadmap earlier or even got guidance from someone with hands-on real-world experience, I might not have wasted so much of my time pursuing dead ends. Learn from my mistakes, don't waste your time with free online courses. FYI I'm not here to spread hate on free content, honestly, there is plenty of quality content you can find online for free. I'll even list some free resources below. This blog is just a letter of regret, the regret of just completing courses instead of applying the skills I had learnt on personal projects, which would have given me much better returns.</p>

    <br>

    <p class="blog-para">If you are looking into learning technical skills, you probably want to apply those skills professionally for personal projects, work on open source or simply to get a well-paying job or even an internship. If that's the case, I would strongly urge every single one of you to find your field of interest, research about the field, its future and make an informed decision.</p>

    <br>
        
    <p class="blog-para">Finally, it's important to know and understand more than just the basics, you need mastery to excel, no matter what your end goal is. I would urge you all to look into some cohort courses or get into a well structured paid course with well-renowned mentors. Mentors are much more important than you think, in fact, I would go as far as to say- they are the MVPs of your roadmap to success.</p>

    <br>

    <p class="blog-para">Although I understand it might be overwhelming to find a paid course worth your money when there is such an abundance of free online courses, but remember- it's never a bad idea to spend on your personal & professional growth.</p>
